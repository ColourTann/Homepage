    		<h1>A New Start</h1>		
			<p>
				This is the start of my new blog. I've made a huge change in my life recently and I'd like to write about my plans, thoughts, progress and show the things I'm working on.
			</p>
			<h4>Career</h4>
			<p>
				I've worked as a Java serverside programmer for about 3 years now. It's an ok job but I found I had little time or energy to work on personal projects at home. I found my previous job unsatisfying and frustrating and I've quit with enough money to live jobless for 2-3 years and plan to properly finish a couple of projects.
			</p>
			<h4>Location</h4>
			<p>
				I've lived in and around London for all my life. It's a bustling place; the museums are excellent and you can find anything you want a train and a bus away. I don't think I got much benefit from living there though, I like to stay away from crowds and enjoy my own company.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've moved to the Peak District, the rent is around 1/4 what I paid before. I'm now living with people which is nice so far. The wildlife is amazing here compared to London, I've seen about 25 species of bird in the week I've been here so far. There are some hills with amazing views. The community spirit is really nice, many people greet you as you walk past. People sell eggs on their wall using a trust system. There's a small village nearby and it makes me jealous of people who grew up here!
			</p>
			<h2>Plans</h2>
			<p>
				Programming is my passion. I love it and I wish I had 10 more lifetimes to explore it properly. I've decided to spend all my savings on taking time to finish a couple of projects that I am most interested in.
			</p>
			<h4>Slice &amp; Dice</h4>
			<p>
				There's a game I've been working on for years. It's a dice roguelike rpg thing. I'm pretty excited about it. I get a lot of good feedback from people who've played it for hours. It's a long way from finished but I have big plans for it.
			</p>
			<h4>Evolution</h4>
			<p>
				I have become totally obsessed with life and evolution. I've got some theories I want to test out. I think I may be able to create some form of artificial life as a testbed for evolutionary theories. I don't know what has been done in this field so far, I want to try by myself for a few months before researching.
			</p>
			<h4>Website</h4>
			<p>
				I've always worked on and improved other people's servers and websites in my time as a programmer. I'd like to make a website from scratch and see what it ends up with. I'm going to try to add something every Monday and improve the site as I go.
